# Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

## Project Abstract

- This user-friendly website allows for a user to play a game of Rock Paper scissors against a computer opponent. The user has the option of choosing two levels of difficulty (Classic and Difficult). Both game rules are displayed on the home page. In the classic version, the user can choose between rock, paper and scissors and the chosen image will face off against the computer image. The website will let the user know who won and add that win count to either player on the right or left side of the screen. The page will then return back to the classic page. The user can then click the 'change game' button to return home or continue playing. For whichever player is ahead in regard to win counts, a crown emoji will appear above their token icon. In the difficult section, the user can choose between 5 icons (with the addition of a lizard and alien). The winner and loser icons will appear on the page and the website will tell you who won. The win count will be updated. The win counts do not persist on page load, so if the user refreshes the page, the win count will return to 0. 

## Installation Instructions

- To access this website, navigate to the [Github respository](https://github.com/hvohr/rock-paper-scissors) and fork the repository. You then want to clone it down on your local machine by copying the SSH key and typing `git clone` with the SSH key after it. You then want to `cd` into the new directory labeled rockPaperScissors. Run `open index.html` in the terminal to view the application in the browser.

## Contributors

- This project was constructed by [Hollis Vohr](https://github.com/hvohr), a Mod 1 student at Turing. This was my final project, an accumulation of the material I have learned through the first module.

## Learning Goals

- This final project showcased all that I had learned through the module. This includes Javascript foundationals, Cascading Sheet Styles (CSS) and HyperText Markup Language (HTML). The learning goals of this project was to write concise and DRY Javascript, CSS, and HTML that is easy to read and produces a functioning website. I worked with VSCode and Github, ensuirng proper git workflow habits. The final website would produce a functioning game of Rock Paper Scissors that would have two levels and keep track of wins/losses.

## Wins and Challenges

- A win that I had from this project was producing a functioning website that held DRY Javascript functions and conscise CSS and HTML. There was an effort to produce a lack of repeats in all three of the languages. Another win I had was adding the feature of the crown to the emoji that was currently in the lead. It does not appear when the players are tied but does appear when one is ahead of the other. A challenge I faced during this project was putting the winner image and loser image onto the screen without adding to the HTML directly with repeated images. A solution for this issue was the creation of a new image through code and the deletion of that image soon after. This left clean and conscise HTML.
